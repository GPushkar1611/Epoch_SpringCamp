# Pincode Clustering and Analysis â€“ Home State Focus

This project focuses on analyzing pincode data specific to my home state using k-means clustering techniques and visualizations. The task was based on the dataset `clustering_data.csv`, which contains pincode information across India, including latitude and longitude.

## Objectives

- **Data Filtering**  
   Filtered the dataset to include only the entries that belong to my home state.

- **Data Visualization**  
   Visualized the geographical distribution of the pincodes using latitude and longitude coordinates to understand their spread across the state.

- **Clustering Analysis**  
   Implemented the **k-means clustering algorithm from scratch** (without using any built-in functions) to identify natural groupings of pincodes based on their geographical coordinates.

- **Visualization and Preprocessing**  
   Applied data preprocessing techniques (e.g., handling missing values and duplicates) and used visual tools like scatter plots to illustrate the clusters

## Tools Used

- **Python**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Plotly**
